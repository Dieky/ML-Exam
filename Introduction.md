## Introduction

This project explores the use of machine learning and local large language models to analyze, cluster, and provide recommendations for Airbnb listings across European cities.

The work builds on two key components:
Part 1 applies machine learning techniques, using unsupervised learning (such as KMeans clustering) and supervised learning (such as linear regression) to process the dataset, uncover patterns, and predict prices based on user-defined features.

Part 2 extends the analysis by integrating a local large language model (LLaMA 3) using the Ollama API, enabling natural language interaction with the dataset. This setup allows users to query the data using conversational prompts and compare the insights generated by the local AI model against those produced by traditional machine learning models.

The project leverages Jupyter Notebooks for data handling and model development, Docker-hosted LLaMA 3 for local AI querying, and a cleaned Airbnb dataset enriched with price, location, and accommodation details. Together, these tools enable a system that combines structured model-driven analysis with flexible, AI-assisted recommendations.

## Problem Statement

The central question guiding this project is:
How can we recommend the best Airbnb stays in European cities, tailored to user budget and preferences, using machine learning methods, and how does this approach compare to leveraging a local large language model?

This problem breaks into several challenges:
There is a data challenge. The Airbnb dataset contains mixed types of information, requiring thorough cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to prepare it for analysis.

There is an unsupervised learning challenge. Using KMeans clustering, the project identifies meaningful groupings in the data — such as clusters of affordable stays, centrally located listings, or larger accommodations — without the need for predefined labels.

There is a supervised learning challenge. Linear regression models are used to predict listing prices, enabling the system to estimate costs and match user budgets to available options.

There is an AI integration challenge. By connecting the processed data to the LLaMA 3 model through the Ollama API, the project enables users to pose natural language queries and receive tailored insights, providing an alternative and more interactive pathway for exploring recommendations.

Finally, there is a comparative evaluation challenge. The project reflects on how machine learning models and large language models differ in performance, interpretability, adaptability, and ease of use, assessing the strengths and limitations of each approach.

## Project Objective

The objective is to build a hybrid system that integrates classic machine learning models with modern generative AI to deliver personalized travel recommendations. The project aims to analyze and document how each method contributes to solving the problem, and how their combination can enhance the user’s ability to make informed decisions when selecting Airbnb accommodations.
