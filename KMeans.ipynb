    "# K-Means Clustering Analysis of Airbnb Data\n",

    "This notebook performs K-means clustering analysis on Airbnb listing data to identify distinct groups of listings with similar characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is K-Means Clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points together (clustering) by trying to separate samples into n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by:\n",
    "1. Randomly selecting k initial centroids (k is specified by the user)\n",
    "2. Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid\n",
    "3. Recalculating the centroids as the mean of all points assigned to that cluster\n",
    "4. Repeating steps 2-3 until the centroids no longer change significantly\n",
    "\n",
    "For Airbnb data, clustering helps identify natural groupings in the marketplace - such as luxury properties, budget accommodations, or family-friendly options - which can provide insights for hosts, guests, and the platform itself."

    "## Finding Optimal Number of Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest challenges in K-means clustering is determining the optimal number of clusters (k). If k is too small, we might combine groups that should be separate; if k is too large, we might artificially split what should be one cohesive group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Elbow Method: How It Works and Why We Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "The elbow method is a visual and quantitative technique to find the appropriate number of clusters by plotting the inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) against different values of k. The process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data preparation**: Selecting and standardizing numerical features to ensure each feature contributes equally to distance calculations\n",
    "   - Standardization is crucial because features with larger scales (like price) would otherwise dominate the clustering compared to features with smaller scales (like ratings)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Running K-means with different k values**: We try a range of k values (1-12) to see how the model performs with different numbers of clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculating inertia for each k**: Inertia measures how internally coherent clusters are\n",
    "   - Mathematically, it's the sum of squared distances between each point and its assigned cluster center\n",
    "   - Lower inertia = points are closer to their centroids = more compact clusters\n",
    "   - Inertia will always decrease as k increases (with k=n, each point could be its own cluster with zero inertia)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Finding the 'elbow point'**: The point where adding another cluster gives diminishing returns\n",
    "   - This appears as a bend or \"elbow\" in the plot where the rate of inertia decrease slows significantly\n",
    "   - Intuitively, this is where we've captured most of the natural structure in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a Percentage Improvement Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "Since eyeballing the elbow point can be subjective, we've added a simple percentage rule: when adding another cluster improves things by less than 8%, we stop there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why 8%? We tried several values:\n",
    "- Higher values (10-15%) gave too few clusters, lumping together listings that seemed different\n",
    "- Lower values (3-5%) created too many clusters with minimal differences\n",
    "- 8% hit the sweet spot for our data\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a clear stopping rule while still respecting the visual elbow method. You can adjust this threshold in the code if needed."

    "### Feature Selection for Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right features for clustering is critical. We've selected features that capture different aspects of Airbnb listings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Price metrics**: `realSum` - the actual price paid by guests, one of the most important factors in accommodation choice\n",
    "- **Capacity and size**: `person_capacity`, `bedrooms` - indicate how many people can stay and the size of the property\n",
    "- **Quality indicators**: `cleanliness_rating`, `guest_satisfaction_overall` - measure guest experience and property quality\n",
    "- **Location metrics**: `dist` (distance to city center), `metro_dist` (distance to nearest metro/public transit) - location is a critical factor in accommodation value\n",
    "- **Host characteristics**: `host_is_superhost_bool` - whether the host has achieved Airbnb's Superhost status (0=no, 1=yes), indicating reliability and quality\n",
    "- **Booking attributes**: `Is_weekend_bool` - captures if the listing is mainly booked for weekends (0=no, 1=yes), suggesting different target travelers\n",
    "- **Property type**: `room_private_bool` - distinguishes between private rooms (1) and entire properties (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these features provides different information that helps the algorithm identify natural groupings in the data. The boolean features (ending with `_bool`) are encoded as 0/1 values, and K-means treats them as numerical distances just like other features. After standardization, these binary features will contribute meaningfully to the clustering based on their distribution in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Need Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means measures how similar listings are using distance calculations. Without standardization, our results would be skewed:\n",
    "- Prices ($20-$500) would overwhelm everything else\n",
    "- Ratings (1-5 scale) would barely matter\n",
    "- Yes/no features (0-1) would be practically ignored\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardizing puts all features on equal footing, so a 1-star difference in ratings can be just as important as a $50 difference in price."

    "\n",
    "### Understanding Cluster Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate summary statistics (means) for each feature within each cluster. This creates a \"profile\" for each cluster, helping us characterize what types of listings each cluster contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a cluster with high values for:\n",

    "\n",
    "While tables with numbers are precise, they can be difficult to interpret at a glance. Radar charts (also called spider or web charts) provide a powerful visual alternative:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-dimensional visualization**: Each axis represents a different feature group\n",
    "2. **Intuitive shape comparison**: The shape formed by each cluster creates a visual \"fingerprint\" \n",
    "3. **Feature grouping**: We combine related features to simplify the visualization\n",
    "4. **Relative comparison**: The chart shows how clusters compare to each other on each dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Feature Grouping Works\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the radar chart, we condense our 10 original features into 5 intuitive groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distance**: Average of `dist` (distance to city center) and `metro_dist` (distance to public transit) \n",
    "- **Accommodation**: Average of `bedrooms` and `person_capacity` to represent property size\n",
    "- **Quality**: Average of `cleanliness_rating` and `guest_satisfaction_overall` to represent overall experience\n",
    "- **Price**: Using `realSum` directly as the sole price metric\n",
    "- **Superhost**: Using `host_is_superhost_bool` directly\n",
    "\n",
    "For each cluster, we calculate the average value for each feature group. For example, the Distance value for a cluster is the average of the mean `dist` and mean `metro_dist` values for all listings in that cluster. This grouping makes patterns more apparent while preserving the most important dimensions of variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Radar Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "In our radar chart:\n",
    "- Each colored polygon represents one cluster\n",
    "- Each axis represents a feature group (Distance, Accommodation, Quality, Price, Superhost)\n",
    "- Higher values (closer to 1) mean that cluster scores highly on that feature group relative to other clusters\n",
    "- The distinctive shape of each polygon helps identify the cluster's unique characteristics \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a cluster with high values on Price and Quality but low on Distance might represent \"Luxury properties further from city center\" - this pattern is instantly visible in the radar chart's shape.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Spotting distinct groups of similar properties\n",
    "- Creating visualizations that show what makes each group unique\n",
    "- Understanding what defines each cluster (price, location, quality, etc.)\n",

    "\n",
    "For hosts:\n",
    "- See where your property fits in the market\n",
    "- Set better prices by comparing to similar properties\n",
    "- Know which improvements might boost your listing to a better cluster\n",
    "\n",

    "- Find what you're looking for faster\n",
    "- Understand what you get at different price points\n",
    "- Know which features typically come together\n",

    "For Airbnb:\n",
    "- Improve property recommendations\n",
    "- Analyze market differences between cities\n",
    "- Spot opportunities in underserved segments\n",

    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To take this further, we could:\n",
    "- Add text analysis of reviews and amenities\n",
    "- Track how clusters change over time\n",
    "- Map clusters geographically within cities\n",
    "- Look for sub-groups within our clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "We've saved the clustered data so it's ready for these follow-up analyses."
